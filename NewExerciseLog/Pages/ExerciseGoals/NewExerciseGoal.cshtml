    by the time the user clicks the update button, the following info should be entered by the user
    UserID - should already be known, somehow. but we can cheat by forcing it to always be 1 until we figure it out
    Exercise IDs - passing multiple or none
    and Goals (as a string) - one for each Exercise ID
